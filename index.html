				<h1>Ansh Roshan</h1>
				<p>My name is Ansh Roshan and I am a college student studying Electrical Engineering. I come from a
					small town in
					the
					Midwest, where I grew up with my parents and three siblings. Growing up, we were all very close and
					spent our days
					playing together outside or working on projects around the house. As an adult, my family remains one
					of the most
					important parts of my life; they are always there to support me no matter what path I choose to take
					in life.</p>

				<h2><i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-child"></i>Childhood</h2>
				<p>
					I have had an interest in computers since childhood when my father first showed me how to build them
					from
					scratch using spare parts he found at work or online auctions sites like eBay. From that moment
					forward, it was clear
					that this was something special for me -something that could open doors into new opportunities if
					pursued correctly!

				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i></i>Learning</h2>
				<p>
					Since then, I have been learning more about programming languages such as Java and C++ while also
					exploring other aspects of computing such as web design or artificial intelligence research projects through various
					courses offered at school both online & offline platforms available today which has helped shape who am
					today - A passionate tech enthusiast looking forward towards making meaningful contributions within this field
					someday soon!
